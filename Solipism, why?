# What is solipism
It is the belief that you are the only thing you know that exists in the world.
As the only thing you know to exist is yourself. Being within your own mind you are able to see that you yourself is a living prospering thing, that it is a 
real thing. In some sense solipism is the answer that can't really be refuted because how can you ever show that something else is really existing like you are?

#Why not solipize?
Because people aren't capable of creating the world in their minds or just simply believe everything is made up in their brains. Why? Becuase it seems to
ridiculous, we aren't all powerful beings we are humans underneath god's rule. As it is the belief that the world can be explained by the simple facts and 
positions of truth. I believe that the world is explained by god's gracious words. Or perhaps the world is explained through the idea we aren't powerful.

#Why solipize?
When you look at something and you call it by it's name, what are you doing?
