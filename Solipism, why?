# What is solipism
It is the belief that you are the only thing you know that exists in the world.
As the only thing you know to exist is yourself. Being within your own mind you are able to see that you yourself is a living prospering thing, that it is a real thing. In some sense solipism is the answer that can't really be refuted because how can you ever show that something else is really existing?
